### Instant Ruby Cucumber Framework

    $ bddfire fire_cucumber

One command will install Ruby Cucumber framework with all possibly supported tools. This will create all the directories and files to support following tools
        * Capybara
        * Selenium-Webdriver
        * Poltergeist: PhantomJS based headless driver for capybara
        * Appium : Mobile test automation Framework
        * Saucelabs : Cloud testing framework
        * Browserstack : Cloud testing framework
        * Relish : Living Documenation
        * Yard : Cucumber documentation
        * Rubocop : Ruby code review tool
        * CI Support Script


If you don't already have a `Gemfile` or `Rakefile`, one will be created.

Output will look like this:

      append  Gemfile
      create  Rakefile
      create  features/step_definitions/google_steps.rb
      create  features/step_definitions/{project_nemae}_steps.rb
      create  features/{project_nemae}.feature
      create  features/google.feature
      create  cucumber.yml
      create  .rubocop.yml
      create  .ruby-version
      create  .travis.yml
      create  .relish
      create  .yard.yml
      create  browser.json
      create  package.json
      create  README.md
      create  ci_script
      create  features/support/env.rb
      create  features/support/hooks.rb
      create  features/support/responsive.rb
      create  features/pages/HomePage.rb
      create  features/pages/Abstract.rb
      create  features/support/helpers.rb

     $ bundle install

Once installed, you can run cucumber with multiple caybara driver 

 Use Selenium 

      $ bundle exec cucumber -p selenium

     $ ./node_modules/.bin/appium

 Now run cucumber with appium 
 
     $ bundle exec cucumber -p appium
