# bddfire

BDDfire: Automate Mobile & Web apps with less code. An instant Ruby-Cucumber BDD framework which supports various popular open-source libraries like Capybara, Selenium-WebDriver, Poltergeist, Relish, Cuke_sniffer, Rubocop, Appium, Saucelabs, Browserstack. Generate default toolkit around BDD with cucumber and friends. It also added support for Docker, Gatling, Axe Accessibility Engine

### ===BDDfire: Write your tests not Framework===

## Installation

The usual:

    $ gem install bddfire

or include it into the Gemfile

    gem 'bddfire'

## Usage

In your project's root directory...

### Instant Ruby Cucumber Framework

## Cucumber

    $ bddfire fire_cucumber


This will create 'cucumber' directory and one command will install Ruby Cucumber framework with all possibly supported tools in the 'cucumber' directory. This will create all the directories and files to support following tools
* Capybara
* Selenium-Webdriver
* Poltergeist: PhantomJS based headless driver for capybara
* Docker support to execute scenarios inside docker containers
* Run scenarios in parallel 10 processes and rerun failed scenarios.
* Appium : Mobile test automation Framework
* Saucelabs : Cloud testing framework
* Browserstack : Cloud testing framework
* TestingBot : Cloud testing framework
* Relish : Living Documentation
* Yard : Cucumber documentation
* Rubocop : Ruby code review tool
* CI Support Script

## Load Testing : Gatling
       $ bddfire fire_load
It will setup Load testing environment with gatling. It will create 'load' directory. It's optional but BDDfire will support it to execute your load tests.

## Accessibility Testing : Axe Engine

     $ bddfire fire_accessibility

It will setup accessibility frameworks in the 'accessibility' directory. It uses Axe engine to run accessibility tests.

## Docker Support

BDDfire allow you execute your cucumber scenarios inside Docker containers. Scenarios with Poltergeist driver can be ran inside containers


### Install & Run BDDfire framework


Now, we need to run bundle install [Fix nokogiri error if you get any by using supported nokogiri version]

     $ cd cucumber
     $ bundle install

Once installed, you can run cucumber with multiple cabybara driver

#Usage
### Pre-defined-steps
You can use[Browser based](https://github.com/Shashikant86/bddfire/blob/master/pre-defined-steps/capybara_steps.md) steps
You can use headless Poltergeist based [headless Poltergeist based](https://github.com/Shashikant86/bddfire/blob/master/pre-defined-steps/headless_steps.md) steps

You can also use [Accessibility steps](https://github.com/Shashikant86/bddfire/blob/major-refactor/pre-defined-steps/accessibility_steps.md)

### Parallel Cucumber & Re-run Failed
You can run entire test suite in 10 different processes but you can increase number of processes. The reports are generated for each process. If any scenario failed it will re-run. It will use poltergeist by default but you can change in Rakefile

         $ bundle exec rake parallel_cucumber

###Selenium Firefox
You can use selenium driver to run scenario in browser [firefox].

      $ bundle exec rake selenium

###Headless Poletergeist
You can use PhantomJS based Capybara driver Poltergeist driver.

      $ bundle exec rake poltergeist

###Chrome Driver
You can run your scenarios in Google Chrome

           $ bundle exec rake chrome


###Cloud Testing Frameworks
 Please enter your USERNAME and KEY in the env.rb file

         $ bundle exec rake sauce/browserstack/testingbot


###Appium:
Run Appium server in the background.

     $ npm install
     $ ./node_modules/.bin/appium
OR

     $rake start_appium

 Now run cucumber with appium. Make sure you updated env.rb file with capabilities you want to use for Android.

     $ bundle exec cucumber -p appium ADB_SERIAL=serial_number

 Now run cucumber with appium iOS. Make sure you updated env.rb file with capabilities you want to use for iOS

     $ bundle exec cucumber -p appium

###Cuke_sniffer
You can use cuke_sniffer to detect smells in your Cucumber. It will generate reports in the cuke_sniffer.html in the 'reports' directory.

      $ rake cuke_sniffer

###Rubocop

You can use rubocop to detect ruby errors in your Ruby file

      $ rake rubocop
This will report all the offence in rubocop.


## Docker

We can run our cucumber scenario inside Docker containers. Assuming you have Docker installed. Check your Docker installation before using.

      $ bundle exec rake docker
This will build Docker image 'bddfire-ci' and run cucumber scenarios inside container 'bddfire-ci'.       

## Gatling

You can use Gatling setup to execute load tests against your endpoints. Simply change 'load/user-files/simulation/SampleLoadTEST.scala' file and puts your URL to Test as base URL.

          $ cd load
          $ sh gatling_local.sh
This will run load tests against your url. You are free to record new simulations. Once finished there will be link to HTML report at the end.

There is CI integration to plug it with jenkins.

## Accessibility Testing : Axe

We can run accessibility checks on our web page using BDDfire. You have to pass URL as environment variable e.g

       $ bundle exec cucumber accessibility/features URL="http://www.google.co.uk"


## CI Integration

Currently, you can use the script 'ci_script' on Jenkins or Hudson. More CI Integration is on the way.

You need pass rake task to the script

      $ ./ci_script features


# TODO

 * Add more and more steps so that user won't need to write more code
 * Add examples to show use of native app automation
